# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Problem
In the competitive telecom industry, customers have the freedom to choose from various service providers, leading to an annual churn rate averaging between 15-25%. Given that acquiring new customers is significantly more costly than retaining existing ones, telecom companies prioritize customer retention over acquisition.

Retaining highly profitable customers is a primary objective for many established operators. To tackle churn effectively, telecom firms must anticipate which customers are likely to churn.

This project involves analyzing customer-level data from a prominent telecom company, constructing predictive models to pinpoint high-risk churn customers, and identifying key indicators of churn.
